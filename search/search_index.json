A 2D, low order polynomial to remove the bulk background 2. A 2D b-spline to remove high spatial frequency noise 3. A model for strap offsets. __init__ ( self , fnames = None , npoly = 4 , nknots = 40 , degree = 3 , nb = 8 , reference_frame = 0 ) special Parameters: Name Type Description Default fnames list of str, or list of astropy.io.fits objects Input TESS FFIs None npoly int The order of polynomial to fit to the data in both x and y dimension. Recommend ~4. 4 nknots int Number of knots to fit in each dimension. Recommend ~40. 40 degree int Degree of spline to fit. 3 nb int Number of bins to downsample to for polynomial fit. 8 reference_frame int The index of the frame we'll use as the \"reference\" frame for the jitter model. 0 build_correction ( self , column , row , times = None ) Build a background correction for a given column, row and time array. Parameters: Name Type Description Default column 1D np.ndarray of ints Array between 0 and 2048 indicating the column number. NOTE: Columns in TESS FFIs and TPFs are offset by 45 pixels, and usually are between 45 and 2093. required row 1D np.ndarray of ints Array between 0 and 2048 indicating the row number. required times None, list of ints, or np.ndarray of floats Times to evaluate the background model at. If none, will evaluate at all the times for available FFIs. If array of ints, will use those indexes to the original FFIs. Otherwise, must be an np.ndarray of floats for the T_START time of the FFI. None Returns: Type Description np.ndarray 2D array with shape ntimes x nrow x ncolumn containing the background estimate for the input column, row and times. fit_model ( self ) Fit the tess-backdrop model to the files specified by fnames . load ( self , sector , camera , ccd ) Load a model fit to the tess-backrop data directory. Parameters: Name Type Description Default sector int TESS sector number required camera int TESS camera number required ccd int TESS CCD number required save ( self ) Save a model fit to the tess-backrop data directory. Will create a fits file containing the following extensions 1. Primary 2. T_START: The time array for each background solution 3. KNOTS: Knot spacing in row and column 4. SPLINE_W: Solution to the spline model. Has shape (ntimes x nknots x nknots) 5. STRAP_W: Solution to the strap model. Has shape (ntimes x 2048) 6. POLY_W: Solution to the polynomial model.
